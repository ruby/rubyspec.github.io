<p>The first commit of what would become RubySpec is recorded in the Rubinius
repository on Sat Dec 16 07:55:41 2006 +0000. At that point,
<a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> had only been publicly announced about two months
before at RubyConf06 (see a <a href="http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2006/10/20/rubyconf-sydney-and-rubinius">nice
summary</a>
of Evan&rsquo;s talk). We did not run much code, but
<a href="http://blog.fallingsnow.net">Evan</a> had already been writing tests for the
development he was doing. The initial spec code was an ape of the unit test
harness, which basically created a subprocess for each test method and made
assertions on the text output from processing some Ruby code.</p>
